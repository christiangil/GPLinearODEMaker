# Kernel functions

Here are the current base kernel functions that were used to construct the `src/kernels` kernel functions

```@autodocs
Modules = [GPLinearODEMaker]
Pages   = ["src/kernel_base_functions.jl"]
```

All of the premade kernels that are included with `GLOM` (in `src/kernels`) were created with this [example script](https://github.com/christiangil/GPLinearODEMaker.jl/blob/master/examples/creating_kernels.jl)
